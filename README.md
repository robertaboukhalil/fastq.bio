# fastq.bio
*An interactive web tool that generates quality metrics from DNA sequencing data.*

**This version of fastq.bio runs the WebAssembly code in the browser.**

See [this repo](https://github.com/robertaboukhalil/fastq.bio-serverless) for the version of fastq.bio that runs the WebAssembly in a serverless fashion.

- The DNA sequencing toolkit [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) is compiled from C to WebAssembly (see Makefile)
- Use [Aioli](https://github.com/robertaboukhalil/aioli) to mount the file a user is given onto a virtual file system in the browser
- Sample random chunks of data from the file and run `seqtk` on that chunk inside the WebWorker (to preserve the app's responsiveness)
- Update the plot with results

## Docker

If you want to quickly run (or demo) the tool with Docker, you can build the container:

```bash
$ docker build -t fastq.bio .
```

And then run the container, exposing port 80 on your host:

```bash
$ docker run --name fastq.bio -d --rm -p 80:80 -it fastq.bio
```

You should then be able to open your browser to `127.0.0.1`, and select the sample
fastq data to preview the application. You can also select a file from your host.

When you are done, stop the container:

```bash
$ docker stop fastq.bio
```

## Why WebAssembly

In short, WebAssembly allows us to avoid rewriting existing tools like `seqtk` to JavaScript, and gives us a significant speedup over running it in JavaScript:
